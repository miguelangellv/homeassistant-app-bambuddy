## 📋 Requirements

- Home Assistant OS or Supervised installation (Supervisor required)
- Supported architecture: aarch64 or amd64

---

## 📦 Installation

### Via button (recommended)

Click the button below to automatically add the repository to Home Assistant:

[![Add Repository to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/Spegeli/homeassistant-app-bambuddy)

Or add it manually:

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Apps → App Store**
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/Spegeli/homeassistant-app-bambuddy`

---

Once the repository is added, you'll find **three versions** of BamBuddy available:

| Version | Description |
|---|---|
| **BamBuddy** | ✅ Stable release — recommended for most users |
| **BamBuddy (Beta)** | 🧪 Beta release — newer features, may contain bugs |
| **BamBuddy (Daily)** | 🔬 Daily build — cutting-edge, least stable |

Install your preferred version and follow the configuration steps.

---

## 🔄 Automatic Updates
 
This App includes automatic update tracking for all three versions (Stable, Beta and Daily).
 
Updates are checked **every hour**. As soon as a new BamBuddy release is available, it will automatically appear in Home Assistant — ready to install with a single click, just like any other App update.
 
No manual intervention required. 🎉

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

All BamBuddy data (print archive, settings, logs) is stored persistently in the Home Assistant `/data` directory. Your data is **safe across updates and restarts**. When uninstalling, Home Assistant will ask whether to remove the app data as well — if you keep it, your data will still be there after a reinstall.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
 
### HA Ingress — Not Supported
 
HA Ingress is currently **not supported** and is not planned. Bambuddy's SPA architecture relies on a stable origin for API calls, routing, PWA scope, and service workers — all of which are incompatible with HA Ingress's rotating per-session subpaths. This would require extensive rewrites to Bambuddy core.
 
### Virtual Printer — Potential Port Conflicts

When using BamBuddy's Virtual Printer feature, several ports will be bound directly on the Home Assistant host. This may conflict with other installed Apps or services (most notably the **Mosquitto MQTT Broker** on port 8883).

For a full list of affected ports and details, see the **Documentation** tab of the respective App.
