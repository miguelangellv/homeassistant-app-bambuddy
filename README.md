## 📦 Installation

1. In Home Assistant, navigate to:
   **Settings → Apps → App Store**

2. Add the following repository:

   [![Install Add-on](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/Spegeli/homeassistant-app-bambuddy)

   Or add it manually:
   `https://github.com/Spegeli/homeassistant-app-bambuddy`

3. Once the repository is added, you'll find **three versions** of BamBuddy available:

   | Version | Description |
   |---|---|
   | **BamBuddy** | ✅ Stable release — recommended for most users |
   | **BamBuddy (Beta)** | 🧪 Beta release — newer features, may contain bugs |
   | **BamBuddy (Daily)** | 🔬 Daily build — cutting-edge, least stable |

4. Install your preferred version and follow the configuration steps.

---

## 🔄 Automatic Updates
 
This App includes automatic update tracking for all three versions (Stable, Beta and Daily).
 
Updates are checked **every hour**. As soon as a new BamBuddy release is available, it will automatically appear in Home Assistant — ready to install with a single click, just like any other App update.
 
No manual intervention required. 🎉

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

All BamBuddy data (print archive, settings, logs) is stored persistently in the Home Assistant `/data` directory. Your data is **safe across updates and restarts**. When uninstalling, Home Assistant will ask whether to remove the app data as well — if you keep it, your data will still be there after a reinstall.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
 
### HA Ingress — Not Supported
 
HA Ingress is currently **not supported**.
 
**Why:** Bambuddy's frontend SPA makes API calls to an absolute path (`/api/v1/...`). HA Ingress serves the addon under a rotating per-session subpath (`/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/`), which means API calls never reach Bambuddy. This requires a fix in Bambuddy core.
 
---
 
### Embedding via Webpage Panel — LAN only
 
As a workaround, Bambuddy can be embedded inside the Home Assistant dashboard using a **Webpage Panel** or **Webpage Card**:
 
1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Dashboards** (or edit your dashboard)
2. Add a **Webpage Card** or **Webpage Panel**
3. Set the URL to:
   ```
   http://<your-ha-ip>:8000
   ```
   Example: `http://192.168.178.3:8000`
4. Under the addon configuration, add your HA URL to **Allowed Origin URLs**:
   ```
   http://<your-ha-ip>:8123
   http://homeassistant.local:8123
   ```
 
**Limitations of this approach:**
- Works on **LAN only** — not available when accessing HA remotely via HTTPS (Nabu Casa, custom domain, etc.)
- When accessing HA over HTTPS externally, browsers block HTTP iframes (mixed content policy)
 
Full Ingress support will be added once the upstream API path issue is resolved.
