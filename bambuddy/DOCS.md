# Bambuddy – Documentation

## Configuration Options

### Debug Mode

Enables verbose debug logging for Bambuddy. Useful when troubleshooting issues or reporting bugs.

| Option | Type | Default |
|--------|------|---------|
| `debug` | `bool` | `false` |

**When to enable:** Only enable debug mode when actively diagnosing a problem. Debug logging can produce a large amount of output and may impact performance.

## Virtual Printer

BamBuddy supports a Virtual Printer feature that emulates a Bambu Lab printer on your network, allowing slicers to send print jobs directly to BamBuddy.

When a Virtual Printer is created and started in BamBuddy, it will bind to the following ports on your Home Assistant host:

| Port(s) | Protocol | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 3000, 3002 | TCP | Slicer handshake / bind detection |
| 8883 | TCP | MQTT (TLS) |
| 990 | TCP | FTPS file transfer control |
| 6000 | TCP | File transfer tunnel (TLS) |
| 322 | TCP | RTSP camera (X1 / H2 / P2) |
| 2024–2026 | TCP | Proprietary slicer ports (A1 / P1S) |
| 50000–50100 | TCP | FTP passive data transfers |

> **⚠️ Potential conflicts:** These ports are only bound when a Virtual Printer is active in BamBuddy. If another Home Assistant App or service already occupies one of these ports, the Virtual Printer will fail to start. The most common conflict is **port 8883** with the **Mosquitto MQTT Broker** Add-on. Check your running services before enabling a Virtual Printer.

## Data Persistence

All data (print archive, settings, logs) is stored persistently in the Home Assistant `/data` directory. Your data is safe across updates and restarts. When uninstalling, Home Assistant will ask whether to remove the app data as well — if you keep it, your data will still be there after a reinstall.
